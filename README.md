# All memes aside...

Hi! I'm Jacob, a web developer, reader/write, & DnD nerd from Co. Antrim Northern Ireland!
I like to work on fun, innovative, and people-helping projects, mostly in JavaScript related tools & frameworks. If that sounds like your jam [feel free to hit me up](mailto:jacobtmurphy@hey.com). 

Who knows where it could lead?
