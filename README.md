*How I feel printing Hello World for the 404th time*

Hello there! I'm Jacob, a web developer, reader/writer, and tabletop-gaming nerd from Co. Antrim, Northern Ireland, currently living in Cheltenham, England! (For my sins, as we say back home...)

I like to work on fun, innovative, and people-helping projects, mostly in JavaScript related tools & frameworks. If that sounds like your jam [feel free to shoot me a line](mailto:jacobmurphy@fastmail.com). Who knows where it could lead?
